// A function can be marked as "pure" to indicate that it does not modify the contract's state 
//and only relies on its input arguments and return value. A pure function is also not allowed 
//to perform any external calls (e.g. to another contract or to an external API), and must return the same result for the same input arguments.

//Pure functions are useful for performing calculations or other operations that do not depend 
//on the contract's state or external factors, and can be used to optimize the contract's performance 
//by allowing the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) to cache the results of the function.
