what is founctions?
 
 A function is a block of code that performs a specific task and may return a result. 
 Functions can take zero or more input arguments and may or may not return a value. 
 Functions can be either internal, meaning they can only be called within the contract, 
 or external, meaning they can be called by other contracts or by external users via transactions.
 Functions can also be marked as "view" or "pure", which have special properties related to how they can access and modify the contract's state.
