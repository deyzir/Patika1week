//I will explain (constructor) detail ;

//The constructor function is called only once, when a contract is first created, and cannot be called again.
//This is because the constructor is used to initialize the contract's state and set up any necessary resources,
//and these tasks should only be performed once at the beginning of the contract's lifetime.
//example multiple constuctor ;

pragma solidity ^0.6.0;

contract MultipleConstructors {
    uint value;

    constructor() public {
        value = 0;
    }

    constructor(uint initialValue) public {
        value = initialValue;
    }
}
//why is it important where we are using constructor ?

//The constructor function is important because it is used to initialize the contract's state and set up any necessary resources.
//This is the first thing that happens when a contract is created, and it is only performed once, at the beginning of the contract's lifetime.
//The constructor function is particularly useful for setting up the initial state of a contract and establishing any dependencies that the contract may have.
//For example, you might use the constructor to:

//*Set the initial values of state variables
//*Set up any external contracts that the current contract depends on
//*Set the contract owner or other privileged accounts
//*Initialize any mapping data structures that will be used by the contract
//*By using the constructor, you can ensure that the contract is properly initialized and ready to be used when it is deployed to the blockchain.
//If Ä± didnt use it?
//If you do not use a constructor function in your Solidity contract, the contract will still be created and deployed to the blockchain. However,
//the contract's state and resources will not be initialized, which could lead to issues later on.

//For example, if your contract has state variables that need to be set to specific initial values, and you do not set these values in a constructor,
//the state variables will be initialized to their default values (e.g. 0 for numeric types, false for bool, and the empty string for string). 
//This could cause problems if your contract's code assumes that the state variables have been initialized to specific values.

//In addition, if your contract depends on other contracts or external resources, and you do not set these dependencies up in a constructor,
//the contract may not function correctly or may throw errors when it tries to access these dependencies.

//Therefore, it is generally recommended to use a constructor function in your contracts to ensure that

//the contract's state and resources are properly initialized and ready to be used.
