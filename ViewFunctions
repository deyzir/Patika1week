what is view fonction

a function can be marked as "view" to indicate that it does not modify 
the contract's state and does not perform any external calls (e.g. to another contract or to an external API). 
A view function can only read the contract's state and return a value based on that state, and cannot modify the state in any way.

View functions are useful for providing read-only access to the contract's state,
and can be used to optimize the contract's performance by allowing the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) to cache the results of the function.
